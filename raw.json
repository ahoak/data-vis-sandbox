There are some key considerations here like — does the job exist in an environment that has data that's under-utilized and that you can access? Are the potential uses of that data at least adjacent to the nominal job description? Will you be closely supervised or is the potential there for more autonomy / self-direction? Etc. It feels like leaders in the community threw their hands up a bit at this problem a year or two ago — there are in fact ways to tackle it in my opinion.",
